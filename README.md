AsciiDoc Builder
================
#### Another N00b centric toolkit

## About
The Script moves all *TXT* and *HTML* files to the *Done* Directory after each execution, regardless of parsing errors.

## Getting Started
Look in the Done to compare html output with example text file.	

## How It Works
Place a TXT file in the same location as this README file, and double click the asciidoc_builder.command file.
