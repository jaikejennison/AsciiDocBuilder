### About

The Script moves all *TXT* and *HTML* files to the *Done* Directory after each execution, regardless of parsing errors.

### Getting Started

Look in the Done to compare html output with example text file. Place a TXT file in the same location as this README file, and double click the `asciidoc_builder.command` file.
